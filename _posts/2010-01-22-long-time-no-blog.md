It's strange to think that's it's 2010 already and I haven't blogged since June. It certainly hasn't been for lack of things to blog about &mdash; if anything, I've been too busy working on things to blog about them, so whenever I've had something to share I've usually used <a href="http://twitter.com/mjhutchinson/">Twitter</a> because much easier to fire off a quick tweet than to write a blog post. However, I'm determined to start blogging again so that I can share detailed information to which I can refer people more easily.

So, over the next few weeks, I'm going to try to <a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/tags/catchup2010">catch up</a> a bit. I intend to blog about the following topics:
<ul>
<li>Binding techniques for C++ libraries, based on what I learned from PhyreEngine</li>
<li><a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/journal/2010/02/01/iteratorbased_microthreading">A tiny library I wrote for simulating cooperative microthreading using IEnumerable</a></li>
<li>The IPhone addin for MonoDevelop as an example of a custom project type</li>
<li>An update on building Moonlight projects with MonoDevelop</li>
<li>Some of the new features in MonoDevelop 2.2 and trunk</li>
<li><a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/journal/2010/01/24/creating_mac_app_bundle_for_gtk_app">Turning a GTK# application into a Mac app bundle</a> and <a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/journal/2010/01/25/integrating_gtk_application_mac">integrating with the dock and main menu</a></li>
<li>The Mono.TextTemplating T4 library I developed for MonoDevelop's ASP.NET MVC addin, and <a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/journal/2010/05/03/t4_templates_monodevelop">its IDE integration</a></li>
<li>The talk I gave on MonoDevelop at MonoSpace</li>
<li>The difference between Web Applications and Web Sites, and why MonoDevelop only supports the former</li>
<li>Plans for improving the file/project templating system in MonoDevelop</li>
<li>Some of the photographs I've taken over the past 6 months</li>
</ul>

I don't have any particular order planned, so if there's something you'd particularly like to see, leave a comment and I'll try to take it into consideration. I'll link the items in the list through to the posts as I make them.
