According to the <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=1532690756472625027'>RPG Class Test</a>, I'm a spellsword. Unsurprisingly, this is the character type that I always like to play. However, this isn't because I'm playing <em>me</em>, but because I consider it to the the most sensible mixture of skills for a good self-sufficient adventurer.

RPGs usually involve killing lots of things, and you'd have to be an idiot not to have close combat skills in case an enemy gets too close, so a warrior class is a good basis. Going for a character with some intelligence, they'd probably pick a sword or dagger as the most refined of the melee weapons. Given the opportunity, it would be a good idea to pick up a few utility spells to give light, open boxes, teleport back to towns and so on. Given these basic parameters, you're going to end up with a spellsword. That said, a rogue or ranger would also make a good stealth adventurer.

Oddly enough, it's often not easy to play a spellsword character, as RPGs tend to reward characters for emphasising a single class or those multiclasses where the skills directly reinforce each other. This is most obvious in RPGs with large parties, where the party has a mixture of skills, but individuals can contribute most strongly if they focus on a narrow field. In single classes, skills seem to increase at a linear rate, and this mechanic escalates battles to an unbelievably epic level.

I think that it would make much more sense that everyone could easily pick up the basics of sword-fighting and casting simple magical cantrips, and get reaching higher skill levels would become exponentially harder. I don't see why attributes are so often quantised either; surely this is a relic of old pen-and-paper RPGs. Sometimes I'll post my more detailed thoughts on the direction that I believe RPG skill systems should be taking (hint: it's closer to Oblivion than Neverwinter Nights).

<p>Aggressive, but with the brains to back it up:  You are a Spellsword!</p>
<p>Score!  You have a prestige class.  A prestige class can only be taken after you’ve fulfilled certain requirements.  This may mean that you're an exceptionally talented person, but it probably doesn't.</p>
<p>Spellswords combine arcane might with combat know-how.  They're much tougher than mages, like to wear armor, and can cast spells through their weapons.  They're very, very, good at doing lots of damage to a single target very quickly, and while not quite as tough as most fighters, are still pretty hard to kill.</p>
<p>You're both smart and aggressive, which means that you're probably pretty dangerous when pissed off.  You also tend to be somewhat straightforward, which is nice, and don’t have much use for spirituality or mysticism.</p>

Note: The 'conventional' spellsword tends to use magic to increase their damage-dealing capability rather than to broaden their skillset, but I prefer my version, as it makes more sense. I haven't come across a common name for my adventurer class.

Note 2: Why were there so many hidden PageRank-boosting links embedded in the HTML of the cut-n-paste results block? I'm sure one would have done, but I was so annoyed by the unnecessary bulk that I stripped them all out, along with the mess of HTML4 and tables.
