I'm going to be in San Francisco next week for GDC. I'll be wandering around SF on Sunday 27th Feb, going to the <a href="http://gdconf.com/conference/summits.html">summits</a> on Monday and Tuesday, then on the Mono booth in the <a href="http://gdconf.com/expo/">GDC Expo</a> Wednesday through Friday.<!--break-->

If you're at GDC, please drop by our booth! And whether you're at GDC or just in the area, <a href="/contact">drop me an email</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/mjhutchinson">tweet me</a> if you'd like to hang out (schedule permitting) and discuss anything related to Mono in games, Mono in general, MonoTouch, MonoDroid, and MonoDevelop.
