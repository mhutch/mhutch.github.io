I've recently added <a href="http://dresdencodak.com">Dresden Codak</a> to the list of webcomics that I read regularly. It's a wonderfully bizarre and twisted mixture of science, philosophy and religion geekery; Egyptian gods having trouble with Schr√∂dinger's cat, an RPG based upon philosophical arguments, working in a dream world, and and a guide to "traversing the luminiferous aether" are a few of the highlights.<!--break--> The most recent ones have fantastic scripts and art, with particularly interesting layout and colour.

My personal favourites are <a href="http://dresdencodak.com/cartoons/dc_031.htm">Dungeons and Discourse</a> and <a href="http://dresdencodak.com/cartoons/dc_029.htm">Summer Dream Job</a>.
