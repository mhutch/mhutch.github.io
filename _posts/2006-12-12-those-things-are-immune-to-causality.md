I've recently added [Dresden Codak](http://dresdencodak.com) to the list of
webcomics that I read regularly. It's a wonderfully bizarre and twisted mixture
of science, philosophy and religion geekery; Egyptian gods having trouble with
Schr√∂dinger's cat, an RPG based upon philosophical arguments, working in a dream
world, and and a guide to "traversing the luminiferous aether" are a few of the
highlights.<!--break--> The most recent ones have fantastic scripts and art,
with particularly interesting layout and colour.

My personal favourites are [Dungeons and
Discourse](http://dresdencodak.com/cartoons/dc_031.htm) and [Summer Dream
Job](http://dresdencodak.com/cartoons/dc_029.htm).
