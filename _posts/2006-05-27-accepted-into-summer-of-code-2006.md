I have been accepted into Google's Summer of Code 2006!

This time round I will be adding an ASP.NET Project type to <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop</a>, with a proper compilation, preview and deployment workflow. I will then be able to host AspNetEdit in MonoDevelop as its graphical designer for ASP.NET.

I will be posting regular updates on my blog. Right now I'm trying to decide which of ASP.NET's compilations models to support, and how they can integrate with the project model. I'm also familiarising myself with MonoDevelop's extension model.

Apologies for the delay in this announcement, but I only finished exams last Thursday.
