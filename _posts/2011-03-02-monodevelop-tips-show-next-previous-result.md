One of the most useful pairs of commands in MonoDevelop is <em>Show Next Result</em> and <em>Show Previous Result</em>. These commands move through items in the most recently active navigation list. Right after building, they will cycle though the build errors and warnings; after searching, they cycle through the search results; after running unit tests, they cycle though the test failures, and so on.

The commands can be found in the <em>Search</em> menu as <em>Show Previous</em> and <em>Show Next</em>, and the names change to indicate which type of result is active. The keyboard shortcuts on Windows and Linux are <strong>F4</strong> to move to the next result, and <strong>Shift-F4</strong> to move to the previous result. On Mac, they're <strong>Command-=</strong> and <strong>Command-+</strong> respectively.
