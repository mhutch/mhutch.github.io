So far, all five completed tasks for the [Mono
GHOP](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono) have been
MonoDevelop -related. I'm really pleased with the amount of interest we've had
so far. I'd like to thank our hard-working students and mentors, and the
wonderful people at [Google's Open-Source Program
Office](http://code.google.com/opensource) who put this contest
together.<!--break-->

* Dan Abramov submitted [a very cleanly-written
  addin](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/detail?id=3)
  to integrate the Smokey code analysis tool. I'll be using this to tidy up
  minor bugs in the MonoDevelop codebase, and hopefully we can ship it in the
  addin repository after the 1.0 release.
* This was followed by [some fantastic
  icons](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/detail?id=29)
  from [Vinicius Depizzol](http://vdepizzol.wordpress.com) ("videpizzol"), and
  these will certainly be in the 1.0 release. They're not yet in SVN due to my
  pending review of our icon usage and handling in MonoDevelop.
* The completed [Brazilian Portuguese
  translation](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/detail?id=41)
  by Renato Felipe Atilio ("renatoat") is now our most up-to-date first
  translation, though due to changes to our translation infrastructure it's not
  merged into SVN yet.
* The latest addition to our still-meagre documentation comes from "entereczek",
  a [Tutorial for C/C++
  Projects](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/detail?id=40).
  I've put it on the [MonoDevelop
  wiki](http://monodevelop.com/Creating_C_and_CPP_Projects).
* Although not strictly a MonoDevelop contribution, "dwashing" created a
  [MonoDevelop solution for
  F-Spot](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/detail?id=25)
  that's been committed to SVN.

Please continue to suggest, claim and review tasks. We still have plenty left on
the [issue
tracker](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/list)
over at Google Code. Pop over to #mono-ghop on GIMPNet IRC to discuss things or
to hang out with us.
