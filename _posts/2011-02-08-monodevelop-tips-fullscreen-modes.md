Sometimes it's useful to be able to focus only on your code without the distractions of the pads and the rest of your desktop. MonoDevelop has two ways to make this easier.

The <strong>Maximized View</strong> can be toggled by double-clicking on the document tab, or using the context menu on the document tab and selecting <em>Switch maximize/normal view</em>. When in maximize view, all open pads are auto-hidden at the sides of the MonoDevelop windows, and all toolbars are hidden (everything in the toolbars is also accessible from the menus).

The <strong>Fullscreen View</strong> can be activated using the <em>View->Fullscreen</em> menu command. This makes the MonoDevelop window take up the entire screen, hiding the taskbar and the window border.

Both view modes can be used together to maximize the document area as much as possible.
