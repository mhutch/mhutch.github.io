Sometimes it's useful to be able to focus only on your code without the
distractions of the pads and the rest of your desktop. MonoDevelop has two ways
to make this easier.<!--break-->

The *Maximized View* can be toggled by double-clicking on the document tab, or
using the context menu on the document tab and selecting _Switch maximize/normal
view_. When in maximize view, all open pads are auto-hidden at the sides of the
MonoDevelop windows, and all toolbars are hidden (everything in the toolbars is
also accessible from the menus).

The *Fullscreen View* can be activated using the _View->Fullscreen_ menu
command. This makes the MonoDevelop window take up the entire screen, hiding the
taskbar and the window border.

Both view modes can be used together to maximize the document area as much as
possible.
