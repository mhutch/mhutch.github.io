After the caret has been in an identifier in a C# file for a few seconds, then all the usages of that identifier in the current file are highlighted. This provides a nice visual cue for finding related code and following code flow.

There are also commands for quickly moving between these usages. On Windows and Linux they're bound to <strong>Control-Shift-Up</strong> and <strong>Control-Shift-Down</strong>, and on Mac they're <strong>Command-Shift-Up</strong> and <strong>Command-Shift-Down</strong>.
