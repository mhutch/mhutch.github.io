Well, it's exam time again. Five in total; first one on Monday, and the last is two days after I find out whether I've been accepted for the Summer of Code 2006. Not enjoying revision, and these exams &ndash; third year &ndash; are very important.

As for the Summer of Code, I've applied to work on ASP.NET Project Support for MonoDevelop. If I get accepted, I will be integrating AspNetEdit into a proper development environment at last!

My website can now be accessed at the domain <a href="https://mjhutchinson.com">https://mjhutchinson.com</a>, and this redirects to the current site for now. I'll be migrating over after exams.
