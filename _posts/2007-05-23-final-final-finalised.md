About 3 hours ago, I finished my very last exam of my MSci degree: my final
final (the final-year exams are often called "finals"). I have no further
coursework, so apart from some administrative trivialities, my degree is
finished. Hurray!

I shall now be trying to catch up with all the things I've left incomplete over
the past few years: my website photo gallery, some books and games, various
software projects (including MonoDevelop), a couple of websites I run, and so
forth. I will also be enjoying Durham and its surroundings in the wonderful
summery weather.
