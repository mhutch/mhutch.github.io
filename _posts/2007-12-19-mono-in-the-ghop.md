So far, all five completed tasks for the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/">Mono GHOP</a> have been MonoDevelop -related. I'm really pleased with the amount of interest we've had so far. I'd like to thank our hard-working students and mentors, and the wonderful people at <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/">Google's Open-Source Program Office</a> who put this contest together.

<ul>
<li>Dan Abramov submitted <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/detail?id=3">a very cleanly-written addin</a> to integrate the Smokey code analysis tool . I'll be using this to tidy up minor bugs in the MonoDevelop codebase.</li>
<li>This was followed by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/detail?id=29">some fantastic icons</a> from <a href="http://vdepizzol.wordpress.com">Vinicius Depizzol</a> ("videpizzol"), and these will certainly be in the 1.0 release. They're not yet in SVN due to my pending review of our icon usage and handling in MonoDevelop.</li>
<li>The completed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/detail?id=41">Brazilian Portuguese translation</a> by Renato Felipe Atilio ("renatoat") is now our most up-to-date first translation, though due to changes to our translation infrastructure it's not merged into SVN yet.</li>
<li>The latest addition to our still-meagre documentation comes from "entereczek", a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/detail?id=40">Tutorial for C/C++ Projects</a>.</li>
<li>Although not  a MonoDevelop contribution, "dwashing" created a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/detail?id=25">MonoDevelop solution for F-Spot </a>.</li>
</ul>

Please continue to suggest, claim and review tasks. We still have plenty left on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/list">issue tracker</a> over at Google Code.Pop over to #mono-ghop on GIMPNet IRC to discuss things or to hang out with us.
