Three exams down, two to go.

Just thought I'd post a link to my Dr Dobbs Journal [article on AspNetEdit](http://www.ddj.com/184406383#0601ds1)>. It went out about 6 months ago, but I hadn't got round to linking to it yet. It explains a little bit about the reason for AspNetEdit, and the technologies used to bring it to fruition.

There's a terrible photo of me in the article as well ;-)
