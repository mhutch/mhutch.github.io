Hello everyone! <em>(waves to as-yet nonexistent audience)</em>

I finally bring to you some useful content in my blog. I have been accepted onto Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> and will be working with the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono Project</a> to bring you a user-friendly graphical designer for ASP.NET, which will be integrated into the MonoDevelop IDE.

I will be chronicling any interesting developments right here for your amusement and gratification. Stay tuned!
