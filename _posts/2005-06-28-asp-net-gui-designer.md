Hello everyone! _(waves to as-yet nonexistent audience)_

I finally bring to you some useful content in my blog. I have been accepted onto
Google's [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html) and will be
working with the [Mono Project](http://www.mono-project.com) to bring you a
user-friendly graphical designer for ASP.NET, which will be integrated into the
MonoDevelop IDE.

I will be chronicling any interesting developments right here for your amusement
and gratification. Stay tuned!
