Okay, it's not quite as exciting as the title suggests. I've been hacking away on the Services and Component Model, and have reached the stage where I can display controls, select them from a drop-down list, change their properties, and have the change reflected on the design surface.<!--break--> You can't interact with the design surface directly yet, and the controls aren't really in a document, just a collection of controls. But it looks pretty!
