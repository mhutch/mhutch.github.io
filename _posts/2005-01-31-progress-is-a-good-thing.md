I wasn't quite as far as I thought I was.

There were still a few PostgreSQL bugs in Drupal that I had to fix before getting on with theming the site. This turned out to be too big a task for an evening so I modified the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/kubrick">Drupal port</a> of Michael Heilemann's <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/">Kubrick</a> theme, changing the title picture (anyone recogise the mountain?) and the footer, hacking the template so that the sidebar vanishes if it has no content, and making a few other tweaks. Personally I still have my reservations about a fixed-width layout like this - even though it's <em>very</em> pretty - so when I have time I'll fix it up to use relative units.

Additional modules I've installed now are the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/phptemplate">PHPTemplate </a> theming engine, the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/article">Article</a>,  <a href="http://drupal.org/project/trackback">Trackback</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/wiki">Wiki Markup</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/project">Project Management</a>. There's not really much else I need, though I'd like to be able to add screenshots and documentation to the projects.

I turned on comments for completeness, though I don't  expect to recieve any yet. It does mean I'll have to be on the watch for comment spam but I don't think the spammers know about my site yet. Anyway, Drupal offers a Bayesian spam filter when I need it.
