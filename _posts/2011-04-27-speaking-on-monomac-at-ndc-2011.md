I'm going to be at <a href="http://ndc2011.no">NDC 2011</a> in Oslo, and I'll be speaking about <em>Developing .NET Applications for the Mac App Store</em>. The talk will provide an introduction to <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/MonoMac">MonoMac</a> and the native Mac APIs that it exposes to .NET developers, explain the structure of MonoMac apps and how they can be deployed to the Mac App store, and discuss strategies for code reuse across the platforms supported by Mono and .NET.<!--break-->

If you catch me outside my talk, I'll also be more than happy to discuss other Mono technologies that I've worked on such as <a href="http://monodevelop.com">MonoDevelop</a>, <a href="http://monotouch.net">MonoTouch</a>, <a href="http://mono-android.net">Mono for Android</a>, ASP.NET MVC, and the use of Mono in games.
