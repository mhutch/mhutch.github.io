I apologise for not having updated my blog more often. Things have been quite hectic recently...

A month ago (as <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Sep-03.html">announced</a> by <a href="http://tirania.org">Miguel de Icaza</a>) I joined the fantastic <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono<a/> team at <a href="http://www.novell.com">Novell</a>, working on the <a href="http://monodevelop.com">MonoDevelop</a> IDE. Since then I've been busy getting the ASP.NET Project features ready for MonoDevelop 1.0 Beta 1, which we finally released on Monday. It's essentially feature complete for 1.0, except for the "Web Deploy" feature that didn't quite make it into the beta but is currently in SVN trunk.

My "free" time has been taken up with preparing for my upcoming move to Boston, MA, USA this weekend. I'll soon be working with the cool people in the Novell offices in Cambridge! This move is a little daunting, as I've never been outside of Europe before, but I'm really excited about it.
