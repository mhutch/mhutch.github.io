In early February I started writing a series of <a href="/tags/monodevelop_tips">MonoDevelop Tips</a>, and after a solid run of a couple of months, I found it difficult to keep up with the challenging Mon-Tues-Weds-Thu-Fri schedule I originally set for myself, and had to take a break to catch up with all the other things I need to do. I'm building up a buffer of new posts, and I'll resume posting tips in May, on a Mon-Weds-Fri schedule. Now that <a href="http://monodevelop.com/Download/Release_Notes/Release_Notes_for_MonoDevelop_2.6_Beta_2">MonoDevelop 2.6 beta 2</a> is out, I'll also start covering some of the new features in 2.6.

Please go back and read the <a href="/tags/monodevelop_tips">past tips</a> in case you missed any, and rate your favourites &mdash; comments and ratings encourage me to keep doing this.
