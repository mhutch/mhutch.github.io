title: Going to GUADEC 2007

I'm going to <a href="http://guadec.org/">GUADEC</a> 2007, because
<ul>
<li>I hack on a GNOME IDE, <a href="http://monodevelop.com">MonoDevelop</a></li>
<li>GNOME is cool, and there will be lots of cool people at GUADEC</li>
<li>Birmingham is under five hours away by train</li>
</ul>

If anyone would like to meet up to chat about MonoDevelop, Mono, GNOME, Drupal, or anything else at all, please <a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/contact">drop me a line</a> or post a comment, and I'll do my best to find you. I'm afraid that due to other commitments I'll only be around during the Core days.
