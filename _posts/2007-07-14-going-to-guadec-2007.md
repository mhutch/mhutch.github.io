I'm going to [GUADEC](http://guadec.org) 2007<!--break-->, because

* I hack on a GNOME IDE, [MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com)
* GNOME is cool, and there will be lots of cool people at GUADEC
* Birmingham is under five hours away by train

If anyone would like to meet up to chat about MonoDevelop, Mono, GNOME, Drupal, or anything else at all, please [drop me a line](/contact) or post a comment, and I'll do my best to find you. I'm afraid that due to other commitments I'll only be around during the Core days.
