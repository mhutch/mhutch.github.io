The site's only been up for five days and I'm already getting referrer spam. No
comment spam yet, but I'll probably disable comments and trackbacks until I have
some interesting stuff up, and sort it out then.<!--break-->

Thanks to some helpful advice on [Caveat Lector](http://cavlec.yarinareth.net) I
used a bunch of Apache `.htaccess` rules to filter out domains containing
spam-like words. It's likely that there will be some false positives but until I
find another way, it'll have to do.

In other news, Drupal's project module is giving me trouble; it refuses to track
my projects' releases. I think it's PostgreSQL compatibility-related, but the
exact reason is proving to be difficult to track down.
