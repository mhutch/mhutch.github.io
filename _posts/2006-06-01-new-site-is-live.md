My site is live at the new domain, and my old page is now redirecting here. The theme still needs a _lot_ of work, but I have other priorities right now.

Most of the work in setting up the new site has been in migrating from PostgreSQL to MySQL. It wasn't a personal choice, just what happened to be on the servers. I took the chance to do a complete Drupal reinstall, and have a few new features planned for the coming months.
