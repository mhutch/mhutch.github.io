I’d like to make a brief announcement. I’m coming out as transgender - I
identify as a woman, I am changing my name to Mikayla, and I am switching to
she/her/hers pronouns.<!--break--> Going forwards, I would like to ask people to
use my new name and female pronouns, and avoid using my old name and male
pronouns unless unavoidable.

I realize this may see like an abrupt change, but I’m still the same person, and
it shouldn’t really matter to other people. For those of you who want to know
more, I’ve posted [a list of questions and answers](/coming-out).
