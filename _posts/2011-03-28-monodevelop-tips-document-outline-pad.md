One of my favourite pads in MonoDevelop is the document outline pad, which provides an overview of the current document and a way to jump quickly to any part of it. I like to keep it autohidden on the left side of the MonoDevelop window, so that I can quickly bring it up. You can show it using the <em>View->Pads->Document Outline</em> menu item, and change its position and docking to fit your <a href="http://mjhutchinson.com/journal/2011/02/monodevelop_tips_workspace_layout">workspace layout</a>.

Clicking on an item in the Document Outline pad will select or focus that item in the document. Outlines are shown for C# source, the GTK# GUI designer, XML, HTML, T4, ASP.NET, and more.
