Here's a shiny screenshot of AspNetEdit embedded in MonoDevelop. The code's not really ready for use yet, but I'm making good progress. It's been complicated by the fact that I'm running AspNetEdit and its property grid in a separate process so that the ASP.NET controls are isolated from the MD process.<!--break-->

In other news, apologies for the clashing colour scheme of my site. It's also completely broken in IE 7, despite working in IE6. I mean to fix both issues, but it's not a priority right now.
