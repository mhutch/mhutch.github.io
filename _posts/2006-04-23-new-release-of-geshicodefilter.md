title: New release of GeSHicodefilter
created: 1145833785

I have recently upgraded to Drupal 4.7, and it's fantastic. However, the Project module upgrade didn't work (probably because I use Postgres) so I've only just got round to installing it again.

To celebrate this, I have made a new release of my <a href="/project/GeSHicodefilter">GeSHicodefilter</a> Drupal module. It is now Drupal 4.7 compatible, and merges several enhancements from Vince Filby's <a href="http://www.filbar.org/project/geshifilter">geshifilter</a> module.
