I waited till <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension">today</a> to <a href="http://gw.gamewikis.org/wiki/Ascension">ascend</a> in <a href="http://www.guildwars.com">Guild Wars</a>. I managed it with my W/Me main character in well under 10 seconds, equipping a couple of useless mesmer anti-spell skills at the start of the skill bar, followed by <a href="http://gw.gamewikis.org/wiki/Frenzy">Frenzy</a> and <a href="http://gw.gamewikis.org/wiki/Healing_Signet">Healing Signet</a>. The doppelganger AI used these first, making itself very vulnerable to my high-damage warrior skills at the other end of the bar. Naturally, I did all this using <a href="http://winehq.org">Wine</a>, which is surprisingly effective; the only bugs I've noticed have been corrupted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_%28computer_graphics%29">impostor</a> textures and missing battle sounds.

This isn't such a big deal, because my character was already much higher-level that most other ascending characters (470k xp). I was already well past the point at which Elonian characters would ascend in the Nightfall campaign, and had run to Droknar's Forge and done lots of exploring and skill caps there (72% of total map).
