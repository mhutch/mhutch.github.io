Right now I'm no longer hosting projects at this page. Instead it's a summary the publicly-released projects in which I am, or have been, involved.

<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>MonoDevelop</em></dt>
<dd>I am currently employed by Novell to work full time on <a href="http://monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop</a>, the <a href="http://mono-project.com">Mono Project</a>'s official IDE. My focus is on ASP.NET web development, and related features.</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Past Projects</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Google SoC 2006: MonoDevelop ASP.NET Support</em></dt>
<dd>In Google's Summer of Code 2006, I was sponsored to develop ASP.NET support for MonoDevelop.</dd>
<dt><em>Google SoC 2005: ASP.NET Visual Designer</em></dt>
<dd>In Google's Summer of Code 2005, I was sponsored to develop an ASP.NET visual design tool for the Mono Project.</dd>
<dt><em>Drupal GeSHi Code Filter</em></dt>
<dd>I developed a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/geshifilter">Drupal GeSHi filter</a> for syntax highlighting in Drupal pages, and originally hosted it on this page. Other people have since merged it with various independent efforts to create a far superior version, and and moved development to Drupal.org, so I am no longer distributing my version.</dd>
