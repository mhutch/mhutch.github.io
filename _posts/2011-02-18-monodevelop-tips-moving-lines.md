To move lines around in the next editor, use the <strong>Alt-Up</strong> command to move the current line or current selected lines up, and use the <strong>Alt-Down</strong> command to move the lines down. If the language addin supports it, the lines will be re-indented to match the context when they move in and out of scopes.

This is incredibly useful for changing the order of statements.
