I've just handed in the final version of my MSci thesis! It's the culmination of my fourth-year Physics project on <em>Interpretation of 3D Astronomical Data</em>, in which I was studying a spectral datacube of the NGC 1068 Active Galactic Nucleus, trying to discover the structure and properties of this astronomical object from the redshift and distribution of the spectral emission lines. Sometime soon I will be posting some of the PyRAF and Python datacube analysis code that I developed. 

Now I only have to worry about the Project viva, and then three exams from other modules.
