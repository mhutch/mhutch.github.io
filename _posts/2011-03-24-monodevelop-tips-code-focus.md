Code focus is a useful feature that helps to show the structure of your code.
It's activated by hovering over one of the fold markers in the text editor
margin for a few seconds. The activated fold region and its parent regions are
highlighted using graduated colour differences on the text editor
background.<!--break-->

Code focus can also be toggled on and off from the keyboard using the
*Control-Shift-K* shortcut on Windows and Linux, or *Cmd-Shift-K* on Mac. When
activated in this way it's persistent until toggled off, and it follows the
caret, highlighting whichever region it's in.
