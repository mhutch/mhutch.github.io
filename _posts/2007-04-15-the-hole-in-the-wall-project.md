A fascinating video by <a href="http://www.ballpark.ch/blog/index.php?id=833">Sugata Mitra at LIFT07</a>, in which he presents his "hole in the wall project". He's been putting computers in the streets of Indian towns where the children have never seen a computer, and don't even speak any English. It's very interesting how the children have collectively discovered how to use the computers (in English), and how their group dynamics develop and affect the learning process.
