Right now I'm no longer hosting projects at this page. Instead it's a summary the publicly-released projects in which I am, or have been, involved.

## Current Projects

### MonoDevelop

I am currently employed by Novell to work full time on [MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com), the [Mono Project](http://mono-project.com)'s official IDE. My focus is on ASP.NET web development, and related features.

## Past Projects

### Google SoC 2006: MonoDevelop ASP.NET Support

In Google's Summer of Code 2006, I was sponsored to develop ASP.NET support for MonoDevelop.

### Google SoC 2005: ASP.NET Visual Designer
In Google's Summer of Code 2005, I was sponsored to develop an ASP.NET visual design tool for the Mono Project.

### Drupal GeSHi Code Filter

I developed a [Drupal GeSHi filter](http://drupal.org/project/geshifilter) for syntax highlighting in Drupal pages, and originally hosted it on this page. Other people have since merged it with various independent efforts to create a far superior version, and and moved development to Drupal.org, so I am no longer distributing my version.
