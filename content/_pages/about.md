I work on [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/)
and the [Xamarin Platform](http://xamarin.com) at Microsoft. I've worked on
cross-platform developer tools for mobile, web, desktop and game for more than
a decade, primarily around [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com),
[MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com) and the C#/.NET ecosystem.

Outside of work, I'm interested in creative software tools and frameworks,
especially for video games. I'm an avid [Train Jammer](https://trainjam.com),
and enjoy SF+F, hiking, photography and occasionally cosplay. I love to make
things, including cosplay, knitting, electronics and silversmithing.

I occasionally [give talks](/talks). Although I'm not very talkative about
non-technical things, I'm passionate about diversity and inclusion, and
proud to openly represent as trans.

This site is a point of contact and a place for me to post things that I feel
may be interesting to other people. I don't update it very actively, but that
may change ðŸ™‚
