I have been accepted into Google's Summer of Code 2006!

This time round I will be adding an ASP.NET Project type to
[MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com), with a proper compilation, preview
and deployment workflow. I will then be able to host AspNetEdit in MonoDevelop
as its graphical designer for ASP.NET.<!--break-->

I will be posting regular updates on my blog. Right now I'm trying to decide
which of ASP.NET's compilations models to support, and how they can integrate
with the project model. I'm also familiarising myself with MonoDevelop's
extension model.

Apologies for the delay in this announcement, but I only finished exams last
Thursday.
