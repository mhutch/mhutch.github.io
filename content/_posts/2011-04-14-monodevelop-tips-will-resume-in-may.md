In early February I started writing a series of [MonoDevelop
Tips](/tags/monodevelop_tips), and after a solid run of a couple of months, I
found it difficult to keep up with the challenging Mon-Tues-Weds-Thu-Fri
schedule I originally set for myself, and had to take a break to catch up with
all the other things I need to do. I'm building up a buffer of new posts, and
I'll resume posting tips in May, on a Mon-Weds-Fri schedule. Now that
[MonoDevelop 2.6 beta
2](http://monodevelop.com/Download/Release_Notes/Release_Notes_for_MonoDevelop_2.6_Beta_2)
is out, I'll also start covering some of the new features in 2.6.

Please go back and read the [past tips](/tags/monodevelop_tips) in case you
missed any, and rate your favourites &mdash; comments and ratings encourage me
to keep doing this.
