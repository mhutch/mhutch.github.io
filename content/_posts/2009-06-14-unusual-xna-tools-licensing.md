In the Microsoft XNA EULA, I found the following restriction: _You may not use
the software to develop programs that run on any platform other than the
Windows, Zune or Xbox 360 platforms_<!--break-->

I'm no lawyer, but  this sounds like very poor wording. Does this mean that all
source code developed with XNA Game Studio is restricted to use on those
platforms, in perpetuity? That would mean that it couldn't even be used on a
future, new Microsoft platform!

This seems to me to be unreasonable and probably unenforceable.
