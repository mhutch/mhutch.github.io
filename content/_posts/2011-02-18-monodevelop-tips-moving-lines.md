To move lines around in the next editor, use the *Alt-Up* command to move the
current line or current selected lines up, and use the *Alt-Down* command to
move the lines down. If the language addin supports it, the lines will be
re-indented to match the context when they move in and out of scopes.

This is incredibly useful for changing the order of statements.
