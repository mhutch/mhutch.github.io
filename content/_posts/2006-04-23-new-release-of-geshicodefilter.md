I have recently upgraded to Drupal 4.7, and it's fantastic. However, the Project
module upgrade didn't work (probably because I use Postgres) so I've only just
got round to installing it again.<!--break-->

To celebrate this, I have made a new release of my
[GeSHicodefilter](/project/GeSHicodefilter) Drupal module. It is now Drupal 4.7
compatible, and merges several enhancements from Vince Filby's
[geshifilter](http://www.filbar.org/project/geshifilter) module.
