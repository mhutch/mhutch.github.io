The [Google Highly Open Participation (GHOP)
contest](http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8) has been running for a
couple of weeks now, and the Mono Project has seen a fair bit of action. Sadly
we've only had five completed tasks, with a couple more almost done. On a lot of
the claimed tasks, many of the students and mentors have been slow to act, busy
with real life work.<!--break--> I think that the timescale of the tasks makes
things difficult. It's not easy to think up a task that an inexperienced student
can complete within five days, especially considering that they often need to
get up to speed with the technologies before starting, and need to fit it in
around schoolwork. Hopefully now that the Christmas holidays are beginning,
students will have a lot more time to spend on the GHOP!

I apologise to any student who's been held up from starting further tasks
because of delays in reviewing and closing the tasks. Doing a proper job takes
quite a bit of time, and the Mono team has a lot of other important things to do
too, like getting the shiny new [Mono
1.2.6](http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.2.6) and [MonoDevelop 1.0 Beta
3](http://monodevelop.com/Release_notes_for_MonoDevelop_1.0_Beta_3) releases
ready.

I'd like to put out a general request to everyone and anyone in the Mono
community, or working with Mono-based apps, to lend a hand for the GHOP. You can
submit proposals for tasks on the [Mono GHOP issue
tracker](http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-mono/issues/list),
and critique students' work. It doesn't matter if you can't write code &mdash;
help with docs or icons. Go out and send students our way. This has the
potential to be a huge community event. You can find us hanging out on #mono-ghop
as well as [the usual IRC channels](http://www.mono-project.com/IRC)
on GIMPNet IRC.
