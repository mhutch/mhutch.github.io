Three months since I last posted on this site, and all of those early posts were
just about setting the site up. Seems lie the site's a bit pointless, really.
Not that I've been sitting idle; I've been snowed under with academic work. I'll
get something interesting up here eventually, I promise.

For now, let it be known that I am procrastinating my exam revision by upgrading
the site to Drupal 4.6.
