Well, it's exam time again. Five in total; first one on Monday, and the last is
two days after I find out whether I've been accepted for the Summer of Code 2006.
Not enjoying revision, and these exams &ndash; third year &ndash; are very
important.<!--break-->

As for the Summer of Code, I've applied to work on ASP.NET Project Support for
MonoDevelop. If I get accepted, I will be integrating AspNetEdit into a proper
development environment at last!

My website can now be accessed at the domain
[https://mjhutchinson.com](https://mjhutchinson.com), and this redirects to the
current site for now. I'll be migrating over after exams.
