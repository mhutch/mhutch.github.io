I'm going to be in San Francisco next week for GDC. I'll be wandering around SF
on Sunday 27th Feb, going to the
[summits](https://gdconf.com/conference/summits.html) on Monday and Tuesday, then
on the Mono booth in the [GDC Expo](https://gdconf.com/expo) Wednesday through
Friday.<!--break-->

If you're at GDC, please drop by our booth! And whether you're at GDC or just in
the area, [drop me an email](/contact) or [tweet
me](https://twitter.com/mjhutchinson) if you'd like to hang out (schedule
permitting) and discuss anything related to Mono in games, Mono in general,
MonoTouch, MonoDroid, and MonoDevelop.
