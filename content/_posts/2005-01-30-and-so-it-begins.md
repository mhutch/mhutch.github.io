I've been wondering for literally months how to set up this site. I almost went
with a custom coded solution but [Drupal](https://drupal.org)'s logging and
modular 'plug-in features' were ultimately too alluring. The critical question,
as always - what would be the best layout? Which modules to use to categorise
and display my projects? How do I make all these features work together?

I finally got around to setting up the site properly. My year-old half-baked
installation of Drupal should now be fixed (I've reinstalled it several times
playing with various configurations) and set up to do everything I want it to. I
had to use a few modules, several of which had to be ported to PostgreSQL, but
overall the installation process was quite easy. The categories, blocks and
links are all set up and all that remains is to create a theme. Then the content
can be rolled in...
