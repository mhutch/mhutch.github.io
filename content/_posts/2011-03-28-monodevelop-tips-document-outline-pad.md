One of my favourite pads in MonoDevelop is the document outline pad, which
provides an overview of the current document and a way to jump quickly to any
part of it. I like to keep it autohidden on the left side of the MonoDevelop
window, so that I can quickly bring it up. You can show it using the
_View->Pads->Document Outline_ menu item, and change its position and docking to
fit your [workspace
layout](/journal/2011/02/monodevelop_tips_workspace_layout).<!--break-->

Clicking on an item in the Document Outline pad will select or focus that item
in the document. Outlines are shown for C# source, the GTK# GUI designer, XML,
HTML, T4, ASP.NET, and more.
