It's strange to think that's it's 2010 already and I haven't blogged since June.
It certainly hasn't been for lack of things to blog about &mdash; if anything,
I've been too busy working on things to blog about them, so whenever I've had
something to share I've usually used [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mjhutchinson)
because much easier to fire off a quick tweet than to write a blog
post.<!--break--> However, I'm determined to start blogging again so that I can
share detailed information to which I can refer people more easily.

So, over the next few weeks, I'm going to try to [catch up](/tags/catchup2010) a
bit. I intend to blog about the following topics:

* Binding techniques for C++ libraries, based on what I learned from PhyreEngine
* [A tiny library I wrote for simulating cooperative microthreading using
  IEnumerable](/journal/2010/02/01/iteratorbased_microthreading)
* The IPhone addin for MonoDevelop as an example of a custom project type
* An update on building Moonlight projects with MonoDevelop
* Some of the new features in MonoDevelop 2.2 and trunk
* [Turning a GTK# application into a Mac app
  bundle](/journal/2010/01/24/creating_mac_app_bundle_for_gtk_app and
  [integrating with the dock and main
  menu](/journal/2010/01/25/integrating_gtk_application_mac)
* The Mono.TextTemplating T4 library I developed for MonoDevelop's ASP.NET MVC
  addin, and [its IDE integration](/journal/2010/05/03/t4_templates_monodevelop)
* The talk I gave on MonoDevelop at MonoSpace
* The difference between Web Applications and Web Sites, and why MonoDevelop
  only supports the former
* Plans for improving the file/project templating system in MonoDevelop
* Some of the photographs I've taken over the past 6 months

I don't have any particular order planned, so if there's something you'd
particularly like to see, leave a comment and I'll try to take it into
consideration. I'll link the items in the list through to the posts as I make
them.
