I'm going to be at [NDC 2011](http://ndc2011.no) in Oslo, and I'll be speaking
about _Developing .NET Applications for the Mac App Store_. The talk will
provide an introduction to [MonoMac](http://www.mono-project.com/MonoMac) and
the native Mac APIs that it exposes to .NET developers, explain the structure of
MonoMac apps and how they can be deployed to the Mac App store, and discuss
strategies for code reuse across the platforms supported by Mono and
.NET.<!--break-->

If you catch me outside my talk, I'll also be more than happy to discuss other
Mono technologies that I've worked on such as
[MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com), [MonoTouch](http://monotouch.net), [Mono
for Android](http://mono-android.net), ASP.NET MVC, and the use of Mono in
games.
