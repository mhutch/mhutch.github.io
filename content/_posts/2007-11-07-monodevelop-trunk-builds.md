Hot on the heels of Lluis's [MonoDevelop 1.0 Beta
2](http://foodformonkeys.blogspot.com/2007/11/monodevelop-beta-2.html)
announcement, I'd like to announce the availability of frequent builds of
MonoDevelop from SVN trunk, packaged for openSUSE 10.3. If you'd like to get the
latest and greatest bug fixes and features but don't want to build MD yourself,
head over to my [openSUSE Build Service
Sandbox](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3AMJHutchinson)..<!--break-->
The packages will also come up in the openSUSE search for [MonoDevelop
packages](http://software.opensuse.org/search?p=1&q=monodevelop&baseproject=openSUSE%3A10.3).

Warning: these packages are not guaranteed to be stable, though I'll try to push
only usable revisions. I may also enable and disable features at a whim, e.g.
disabling the Boo binding and MonoDevelop.Database addin in order to enable
GtkSourceView 2 support.

_Update: the sandbox link currently requires that you're logged into the
openSUSE Build Service, so here's a [direct link to the
repository](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/MJHutchinson/openSUSE_10.3)_
