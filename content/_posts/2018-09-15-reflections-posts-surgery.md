The past couple months I've been recovering from bottom surgery (gender
reassignment surgery). It's been a strange liminal period of relief and
reorientation.

I don't doubt at all that this is a huge and positive milestone in my
life. I've despised a part of my body as long as I can remember, doing
my best to hide it and write it out of my consciousness to cope with my
dysphoria. It was evidence of my bodily masculinity, dredging up horrible
feelings in an instant if I ever let my guard down.

Now it's gone, and I have something new and unfamiliar. Do I like it?
I don't know, it just _is_. I suspect that's how many people feel about
their bodies. It's still changing as it heals, still a source of discomfort
and awkwardness, so I reserve full judgment, but I’m do know that I'm a
lot happier.

It's hard to describe gender dysphoria to someone who hasn't experienced 
it. You are yourself, but your body is wrong, people don't treat you
right, and you can't express yourself without risking ruinous ostracization.
You overcompensate to fit in and make yourself miserable, and no-one ever
sees your real self because you do your best to hide it away. Every day
you see other people living aspects of the life you wish you had,
blissfully unaware of their fortune because they never imagined anything
different.

The worst part is how it's all tangled up. We're socialized to rigidly
associate body shapes with gender, and gender with behaviors. There's
no objective way to define a what makes a man or woman, it's emergent
from a whole array of factors. All the aspects of dysphoria feed into
your sense of identity. Your body, how people treat you, and how you are
able to express yourself all feed into your sense of self identity, which
in turn affects how you feel about those things.

I’ve overcome a lot of inhibitions, and in many ways I don’t care what
people think about me. But when I look into a mirror, and part of my
body looks male, I don’t feel real. When someone calls me “sir”, I
don’t feel real. I feel like an impostor. I feel like I’m pretending
to be someone I’m not, that “reasonable” people would consider me 
delusional. When people treat me well, I suspect it’s simply because I’m
somehow fooling them, and if they had the full picture, of course they’d
think I wasn’t real. Or they’re just humoring me to be nice.

The biggest contributor to those feelings for me is gone, and it’s a huge
relief. It would be pretty damn hard for anyone now to claim to
objectively call me a man. Of course, that means I’m now worrying about
other things. Should I get top surgery (breast augmentation) or FFS
(facial feminisation surgery)? They’d lessen my remaining dysphoria,
but I don’t know how much. Can I justify the expense, pain and time?
Is it a moral failing to conform to male gaze centric beauty standards
instead of helping to redefine what it means to be a woman?

After obtaining hormones and making a social transition, bottom surgery
for me was a given. I hated that part of myself more than anything else,
so fixing it was a priority. It took time and work: multiple
psychological evaluations, repeated laser hair removal in delicate
areas, time gates, waiting lists, insurance criteria. Part of me still
feels like I showed up fifteen years late, but once I started I made
it over the finish line with a respectable time.

And now I’m done, and I’ve completed all my major goals: social
transition, hormones, bottom surgery. I’m at a loss for what to focus
on next. I’m much happier, but I’m not entirely comfortable in myself.
Hair removal and voice therapy are ongoing, and I’m working on my
empathy, my self confidence, my social anxiety, but none of these
have discrete resolutions. It’s awfully tempting to consider other
surgeries, but I want to do them for the right reasons.

I still look in the mirror, or hear my voice, and although I’m well
into diminishing returns I’m not  entirely happy. I’m lucky that many
people think I look and sound cis (not trans), as we’re all socially
conditioned to value normalization. But I‘ve trained myself to spot
differences, and I have a lot of internalized transphobia. I’m my
own worst critic and I can’t escape myself.
