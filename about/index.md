I work on [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) and the [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com) Platform at Microsoft. Prior to that I worked on <a href="http://monodevelop.com">MonoDevelop IDE</a> and <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">Mono</a> for mobile platforms.

This site is a point of contact and a place for me to post things that I feel may possibly be interesting to other people. I don't update it very actively though.

Outside of work, I'm interested in creative software tools, especially videogame technology. I'm also interested in sci-fi and fantasy literature, exploring and photography, and making jewelry.
